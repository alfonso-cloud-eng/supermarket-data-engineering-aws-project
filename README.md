# Project Overview

This project simulates a real-time data engineering system that can handle supermarket-style transactions. It combines historical data (older transactions) and new, incoming data (fresh transactions) in almost real time. The goal is to make these transactions easy to query, analyze, and visualize at minimal cost, even if there are many stores and millions of SKUs (products).

## Main Components

### Historical (Static) Data:

Stored in Amazon S3 as four relational tables:

- **supermarkets** (store IDs, store names, locations)
- **skus** (SKU IDs, product names, prices)
- **transactions** (transaction ID, store ID, timestamp)
- **transaction_items** (transaction ID, SKU ID, quantity)

The supermarkets and skus tables were generated by a Python script that creates random data (5 stores, 12,000 SKUs in this demo).

The transactions and transaction_items tables come from another Python script that generated 100,000 JSON transactions.

Originally, an AWS Glue job converted those JSON transactions into the two relational tables. But AWS Glue is not ideal for real-time needs and can be costly if run too often.

### Real-Time (Dynamic) Data:

A Python script in AWS ECS acts like a payment processor, generating new transaction logs. These logs are written to an S3 folder.

An S3 event trigger calls an AWS Lambda function each time a new file arrives. Lambda then transforms the JSON data and appends it to the transactions and transaction_items tables (also in S3).

This way, new transactions show up in the data set after only 2–3 seconds.

You can query everything in Amazon Athena, and any QuickSight dashboards will update as soon as the data arrives (just refresh the page).

### Why Use Lambda Instead of Glue?

AWS Lambda reacts immediately when a file lands in S3, so new transactions become available in seconds.

With AWS Glue, you’d typically schedule jobs, which can be slower and more expensive if run too frequently.

### Visualization & Analytics

All data, old and new, can be explored with Amazon Athena (SQL queries) or Amazon QuickSight (dashboards).

The cost is very low because storage in S3 is cheap, Lambda only charges when it runs, and Athena charges per amount of data scanned.

Even as the number of transactions grows, this setup can scale easily. Costs remain small compared to the revenue in a real supermarket chain.

### Conclusion

This AWS-Supermarket-Data-Project is a great example of how cloud services can handle large-scale, real-time transaction data. It uses simple Python scripts, serverless functions, and cheap storage to achieve near-instant analytics. By combining historical records with live transaction feeds, it provides a complete view of store activity at any moment.
